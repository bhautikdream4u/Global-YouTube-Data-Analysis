3. Key Visual Insights

    Bar Plot of Views per Category

      The bar plot provides a comparison of the total views across different categories. The highest-viewed categories, such as Gaming, Entertainment, and Music, are clearly outperforming others. This indicates that these categories dominate in terms of attracting viewer attention, making them critical for content creators to focus on if aiming for a broad audience.

   Heatmap of Correlations

      The heatmap reveals the relationships between various metrics. Strong positive correlations are observed between:
   
      •	Views and Likes       •	Views and Subscribers
   
      This suggests that channels with high views are more likely to receive higher likes and subscribers, reinforcing the importance of content reach. Conversely, there are weaker correlations between comments and income, indicating that engagement doesn’t necessarily lead to higher revenue.

   
   Density Chart of Total Income

      The density chart of total income shows a skewed distribution. A significant portion of channels generates relatively lower income, while a few high-performing outliers account for a large proportion of total income. This indicates that monetization opportunities are highly concentrated among a small number of channels, pointing to a “winner-takes-all” dynamic.

4. Statistical Summary

    •	Views: The average views per channel were found to be in the millions, with a wide range of variance. Top channels dominate the view count while many others have significantly fewer.
    •	Likes and Comments: These engagement metrics show moderate correlations with views, suggesting that while they are important for interaction, they do not directly influence revenue as much as views or subscribers.
    •	Income: The skewed distribution of income reveals that a few top creators earn significantly more than the average channel, reinforcing the competitive nature of content monetization.

      1.	Top Categories: Gaming, Entertainment, and Music are the leading categories in terms of views, highlighting where content creators may want to focus if they aim for high visibility.
      2.	Correlations: Views are a critical driver of other metrics like subscribers and likes, indicating that creators should prioritize viewership growth to enhance overall channel performance.
      3.	Income Distribution: Income is highly concentrated, with a few channels earning disproportionately more than the majority. This indicates a competitive environment where only a few succeed at monetizing their content effectively.
    By focusing on popular categories and maximizing views, creators can potentially improve their income and overall channel performance.
